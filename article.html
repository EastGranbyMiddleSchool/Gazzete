<h2 class="section-title">Article of the Week: What Are Black Holes?</h2>

<article class="main-article">
  <p>
    Black holes are regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing — not even light — can escape.
    They form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycles, creating a point of infinite density
    called a singularity. Around this point lies the event horizon, the “no return” boundary beyond which
    everything is pulled inward forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite their ominous name, black holes play an important role in shaping galaxies and regulating the birth of stars.
    Astronomers believe that most galaxies, including our own Milky Way, have a supermassive black hole at their center.
    These cosmic giants can be millions or even billions of times more massive than our Sun.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope captured the first-ever image of a black hole — a groundbreaking moment in science.
    The photograph showed a glowing ring of hot gas surrounding the dark shadow of the black hole at the center of the galaxy M87.
    This confirmed decades of theoretical predictions from Einstein’s general relativity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, scientists continue to study black holes to uncover secrets about gravity, space-time, and even
    the origins of our universe. Who knows — understanding black holes might one day reveal how everything began.
